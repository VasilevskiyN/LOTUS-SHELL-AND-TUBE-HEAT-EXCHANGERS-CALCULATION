# **LOTUS Sector-Based Calculation Method for Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers**  

## **Abstract**  
An innovative methodology for shell-and-tube heat exchanger (STHE) design is presented, combining the speed of manual methods with the accuracy of numerical modeling. The **LOTUS** approach uses **sector partitioning** and iterative thermal-hydraulic calculations, achieving **<5% error** with computation times of **5–10 minutes**. This method optimizes equipment design and is applicable to petrochemical and energy industries.  

**Keywords**: shell-and-tube heat exchangers, design optimization, thermal calculation, hydraulic calculation, heat transfer coefficient, temperature difference

## **Introduction**  
Traditional manual calculations average fluid parameters across the entire heat transfer surface, masking localized inefficiencies. While CFD simulations offer precision, they are computationally expensive. The **LOTUS method** bridges this gap, enabling rapid yet accurate STHE analysis.  

The system supports multiple configurations:  
- Segmental, helical, and double-segmental baffles  
- U-tube designs  
- Floating-head exchangers  

### **Key Calculation Stages**  
1. Input data preparation  
2. Thermal balance calculation  
3. Geometric parameter definition  
4. Thermal-hydraulic analysis  
5. Design optimization  
6. Report generation

## **Methodology**  
### **Current Approaches**  
| Method                  | Pros                      | Cons                          |  
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Manual (GOST/ASME/TEMA) | Fast                      | Over-simplified               |  
| Semi-empirical (Bell-Delaware) | Accounts for flow maldistribution | Requires coefficient tuning |  
| CFD                     | High accuracy             | Resource-intensive           |  

### **LOTUS Sector-Based Workflow**  
1. **Initial Geometry Setup**  
   - Tube length, count, and passes are determined based on hydraulic resistance limits.  
   - Baffle spacing follows a **gradient-linear distribution** (adjusted automatically).  

2. **Sector Partitioning**  
   - **Shell Sectors**: Defined by baffle spacing (Fig. 1).  
   - **Calc Sectors**: Subdivided per tube passes (e.g., 4 calc sectors for 4-pass designs; Fig. 2).  

3. **Iterative Thermal Calculation**  
   Heat transfer in each calc sector is computed as:
     
Q_i = k_i · F_i · ΔT_log,i

Where:

Q_i = Thermal flux in the sector [W]
k_i = Local heat transfer coefficient [W/(m²·K)]
F_i = Heat transfer surface area [m²]
ΔT_log,i = Logarithmic mean temperature difference [K]

   **Assumptions**:  
   - Calc sectors are thermally isolated (no cross-sector influence).  
   - Outlet temperatures are averaged before progressing to the next shell sector (Fig. 3).  

5. **Hydraulic Optimization**  
   Shell-side velocity is calculated per sector:  
   \[
   v_{\text{shell}} = \frac{G_{\text{shell}}}{\rho \cdot S_{\text{eff}}}  
   \]  
   - Maximizes heat transfer coefficients while respecting constraints.  

6. **Convergence Check**  
   - Reiterates if \(k\), \(\Delta T\), or \(F\) deviations exceed **2%**.  

7. **Visualization & Optimization**  
   - Graphs of temperature, velocity, and vibration profiles (Fig. 4) highlight:  
     - High-efficiency zones  
     - Phase transition onset  
     - Thermal maldistribution

## **Advantages**  
✅ **Flexibility**: Adapts to diverse STHE configurations.  
✅ **Integrated**: Couples thermal and hydraulic calculations.  
✅ **Optimized**: Auto-validates designs against constraints.  
✅ **Fast**: 5–10 min runtime vs. hours for CFD.
